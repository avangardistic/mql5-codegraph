# Known Limitations and Roadmap

The MVP is a tolerant structural analyzer, not a MetaEditor compiler frontend.

- Macro bodies and conditional compilation are recorded but not fully expanded.
- Overload resolution uses scope and arity hints, not complete MQL5 type inference.
- Template-like constructs and complex declarators may be recovered only partially.
- Standard-library calls are represented as external nodes unless their source is included in scope.
- Dynamic dispatch, function pointers, reflective indicator loading, and runtime-generated names are
  not resolved statically.

## Evidence and runtime guarantees

- A stored source location identifies where evidence was observed during analysis; it does not prove that
  the file still exists or has not changed.
- CLI and HTTP currently do not configure a filesystem freshness probe. Located evidence therefore reports
  `unknown/probe_not_configured`; locationless evidence reports `unknown/location_missing`.
- `runtime` edges model documented MetaTrader dispatch or consequences. They do not prove that a handler
  executed in a particular terminal session.
- `inferred` edges remain hypotheses with explicit origin and confidence. Path and context results never
  promote them to extracted or resolved facts.
- Static absence of a path is meaningful only when the eligible bounded search completes. Depth or expansion
  exhaustion is reported as incomplete, not as proof that symbols are disconnected.
- Ambiguous names and unresolved external nodes remain visible. The kernel does not silently choose one
  equal-ranked interpretation.

## Context and performance limits

- `structural_record_v1` is a deterministic graph-record budget, not a model tokenizer estimate and not a
  promise about downstream prompt size.
- Context packages return summaries and evidence metadata, not raw source text.
- The one-second target is an opt-in benchmark result for the documented local machine and fixed synthetic
  workload. It is not a latency guarantee for every repository or hardware profile.
- Analysis and normalized intelligence remain local, single-user, read-only operations over one published
  graph snapshot.

## Release security boundary

- The local dashboard is intentionally unauthenticated and loopback-only. Network binds are rejected rather
  than treated as an operator opt-in.
- Socket reads are bounded by both a two-second idle timeout and a ten-second absolute request-read deadline.
  This controls slow-drip slot retention but does not impose a wall-clock deadline on completed analysis work.
- Include resolution rejects absolute, drive-qualified, UNC, and canonically escaping targets before a
  filesystem existence probe. Explicit include roots remain approved read boundaries.
- Saved graph metadata cannot authorize source reads. The source viewer requires an explicit active root.
- Four low-severity adversarial scaling risks remain accepted only for the local alpha: repeated parser range
  membership scans, overlapping nested-argument scans, repeated binding-list scans, and Cartesian ambiguous
  call-edge fan-out. A hosted or multi-tenant release is gated on explicit work budgets or linear-time
  structures for these paths.

Planned milestones include a formal Tree-sitter MQL5 grammar, richer type inference, incremental indexing,
Graphify/Neo4j adapters, an experimental MCP adapter, protected evidence freshness probes, and
compile-diagnostic correlation with MetaEditor. A stable MCP surface remains deferred until its contracts
can preserve the same versioning, evidence, ambiguity, and completion semantics.
