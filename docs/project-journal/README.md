# Project Journal

This directory is the durable handoff log for MQL5 CodeGraph. It records verified outcomes, decisions,
open risks, and the exact next objective so work can continue safely across sessions.

## Logging protocol

1. Read the newest journal entry, relevant ADRs, and the active specification before changing code.
2. Create one entry per meaningful work session using `YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-short-title.md`.
3. Record evidence, not optimistic summaries. Include commands and observed results for every verification claim.
4. Separate completed work, decisions, risks, and follow-ups. Never mark an unverified item complete.
5. When an architectural choice changes, add or supersede an ADR in `docs/decisions/`.
6. Before ending a session, update the next objective and refresh the Graphify index when tracked knowledge changed.

## Truth hierarchy

When records disagree, use this order: current source and tests, active specification, accepted ADRs, newest
journal entry, Graphify output, then older generated reports.
